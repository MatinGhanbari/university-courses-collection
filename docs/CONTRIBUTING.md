## Contributor License Agreement

By contributing, you agree to the [LICENSE](../LICENSE) of this repository.

### Guidelines

- make sure resource is free. Double-check if needed. It helps the admins if you comment in the PR as to why you think the resource is free.

### Formatting

- All lists are `.md` files. Try to learn [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax. It's simple!
- All the lists start with an Index. The idea is to list and link all sections and subsections there. Keep it in alphabetical order.
- Sections are using level 3 headings (`###`), and subsections are level 4 headings (`####`).


- Don't put spaces between `]` and `(`:

    ```text
    [Another Awesome Resource](http://example.com/resource.html)
    ```

- If you include the author, use ` - ` (a dash surrounded by single spaces):

    ```text
    [Another Awesome Resource](http://example.com/resource.html) - John Doe
    ```

- Put a single space between the link and its format:

    ```text
    [A Very Awesome Resource](https://example.org/resource.pdf) (PDF)
    ```

##### URLs

- We don't permit shortened URLs.
- Tracking codes must be removed from the URL.
- International URLs should be escaped. Browser bars typically render these to Unicode, but use copy and paste, please.
- Secure (`https`) URLs are always preferred over non-secure (`http`) urls where HTTPS has been implemented.
- We don't like URLs that point to webpages that don't host the listed resource, but instead point elsewhere.


##### Time-limited Courses and Trials

- We don't list things that we'll need to remove in six months.
- If a course has a limited enrollment period or duration, we won't list it.
- We can't list resources that are free for a limited period.
